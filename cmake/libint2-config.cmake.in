# libint2-config.cmake
# --------------------
#
# Libint2 cmake module.
# This module sets the following variables in your project:
#
# ::
#
#   Libint2_EXT_VERSION - Libint2 version including buildid, such as beta.3. Prefer target variable.
#   Libint2_MAX_AM_ERI - maximum angular momentum level of Libint2 libraries for 4-center energy
#                        integrals. Prefer target variable.
#
#
# Available components:
#
# ::
